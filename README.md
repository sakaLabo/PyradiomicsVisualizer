# PyradiomicsVisualizer

## Abstract  
Note that although this visualization tool is effective in identifying features, the meaning of features is somewhat different from that of a normal scan.  
Unlike normal operations, this method scans a small mask, computes features, and repositions them as an image.  

## Library

Python 3.7  
pyradiomics 3.0.1
